# Learning Notes for Robot Learning(Part 2)
<br>**Skip back to [Part 1](https://github.com/NZ-Liam-Zhong/Awesome_AI_for_Robotics_Learning_Notes/blob/main/README.md)**<br><br>
As ChatGPT and RT2 appears, many researchers start to do reseaches about AI for robotics. Many scholars have different names for it, including embodied AI, smart robotics, etc. I will update the papers and content that I have read. Unlike the others, I won't just use python scirpt to get the information and abstract, I will share my thoughts after the reading. I promise that very single content listed below I have read it at least once. <br><br> This is **Part 2**. We divide them into many parts because it's hard to read the content if there are too many things in a single repo.<br><br>

## Papers

### (1) Reinforcement Learning & Imitation Learning


### (2) Vision-Language Action Model 


### (3) Dataset & Dataset Generation


### (4) Inference Speed 


### (5) Scene Representation


### (6) Generative Models
**Generative Models are important for robot policy**, we can either use them as tools or understand them deeply<br>




### (7) Sim2Real


### (8)Visual Representation



### (9) Multi-Robot & Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)


## Industry
Here we update some tech advance in the industryðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
There are too many start-ups doing the same thing, boring and useless. So, we will only update the AI for robotic start-ups who make **innovative products**
