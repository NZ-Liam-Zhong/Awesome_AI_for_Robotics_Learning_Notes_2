# Learning Notes for Robot Learning(Part 2)
<br>**Skip back to [Part 1](https://github.com/NZ-Liam-Zhong/Awesome_AI_for_Robotics_Learning_Notes/blob/main/README.md)**<br><br>
As ChatGPT and RT2 appears, many researchers start to do reseaches about AI for robotics. Many scholars have different names for it, including embodied AI, smart robotics, etc. I will update the papers and content that I have read. Unlike the others, I won't just use python scirpt to get the information and abstract, I will share my thoughts after the reading. I promise that very single content listed below I have read it at least once. <br><br> This is **Part 2**. We divide them into many parts because it's hard to read the content if there are too many things in a single repo.<br><br>

## Tutorials & Slides
1.[Reinforcement Learning Basics by Fei-Fei Li](https://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture14.pdf)
Slides for understanding basic concepts for reinforcement learning. **Institutionï¼š Stanford University** They have replicated the success of GPT o1, which is inspiring for robotics.<br>

## Industry
Here we update some tech advance in the industryðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
There are too many start-ups doing the same thing, boring and useless. So, we will only update the AI for robotic start-ups who make **innovative products**
